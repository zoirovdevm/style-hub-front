// WHY THIS EXISTS: the register wizard (phone -> SMS OTP -> details ->
// confirm) used to keep its step/phoneDigits/otpCode/details in plain
// useState inside RegisterPage. That broke the moment someone switched
// language (uz/ru) mid-flow: the language switcher navigates from
// /uz/register to /ru/register, and because `locale` is a *layout*-level
// dynamic segment (the root layout itself lives at app/[locale]/layout.tsx,
// wrapping <html>/<body>), Next.js treats the two locales as distinct
// static routes and fully remounts everything under that layout — including
// RegisterPage — instead of just re-rendering it with a new `locale` prop.
// A fresh mount means useState re-initializes to its default, so a user who
// had already received their SMS code and was sitting on the OTP screen got
// silently bounced back to the phone-entry screen, with the code they'd
// typed (and the phone number itself) gone.
//
// A Zustand store defined at module scope isn't part of that component
// tree, so it isn't torn down and rebuilt when the tree remounts — the
// store object just keeps living in memory, and RegisterPage picks up
// exactly where it left off after the remount. Deliberately NOT using
// zustand's `persist` middleware (no localStorage): this only needs to
// survive an in-memory remount, not a real page reload/new tab, and OTP
// codes/passwords have no business sitting in localStorage.
